# Scale AI: TransformX Conference

## A Global Perspective on AI with Eric Schmidt

> the more clicks you have, the more learning opportunity you have

> China has criminalized being anonymous on the internet, which solves a lot of problems

## Data-centric AI with Andrew Ng

> Good AI needs good data, and good data needs humans-in-the-loop

> I think it's time for us to shift to the data-centric approach to AI, in which you can even hold the code fixed, but instead find systematic tools and methodologies and principles and algorithms to systematically engineer the data so that when the data is trained on the code, it gives you the performance you need
