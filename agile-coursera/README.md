Agile with Atlassian Jira

## What is Agile?

- approach to managing and working on projects
- simple approach to managing complexity
- example projects include
  - software development
  - managing service tickets
  - HR new hire process
  - managing tasks at a picnic
  - writing a book

## Characteristics

1. **Incremental**: plan, development, and release increments
2. **Iterative**: continuously improve the product and the process of builing the product
3. **Focus on value**
4. **An empowered team**: team consists of distributed brain

## Iterative Learning Loops

- scientific method is the foundation of many processes
- examples
  - plan >> build >> release
  - plan >> do >> check >> act / adjust
  - think >> build >> ship >> tweak

## Agile vs Waterfall

### Waterfall

- plan and develop the whole project in phases
- Analyze (use case / requirements) >> Design (spec) >> Build >> Test (QA) >> Release
- effectively "one cycle" of the scientific method
- downsides
  - big up-front plan will be wrong because:
    - can't predict the future
    - high value features aren't correctly identified; you will build many unnecessary features
    - things are harder, more problematic, and take longer to build than you think
    - market and/or team will change while you build
  - change is hard and expensive
  - create a lot of obsolete documents
  - feedback is drastically delayed
- why waterfall?
  - when you have high setup costs
