Agile with Atlassian Jira

## What is Agile?

- approach to managing and working on projects
- simple approach to managing complexity
- example projects include
  - software development
  - managing service tickets
  - HR new hire process
  - managing tasks at a picnic
  - writing a book

## Characteristics

1. **Incremental**: plan, development, and release increments
2. **Iterative**: continuously improve the product and the process of builing the product
3. **Focus on value**
4. **An empowered team**: team consists of distributed brain

## Iterative Learning Loops

- scientific method is the foundation of many processes
- examples
  - plan >> build >> release
  - plan >> do >> check >> act / adjust
  - think >> build >> ship >> tweak

## Agile vs Waterfall

### Waterfall

- plan and develop the whole project in phases
- Analyze (use case / requirements) >> Design (spec) >> Build >> Test (QA) >> Release
- effectively "one cycle" of the scientific method
- downsides
  - big up-front plan will be wrong because:
    - can't predict the future
    - high value features aren't correctly identified; you will build many unnecessary features
    - things are harder, more problematic, and take longer to build than you think
    - market and/or team will change while you build
  - change is hard and expensive
  - create a lot of obsolete documents
  - feedback is drastically delayed
- why waterfall?
  - when you have high setup costs
  - when the work is predictable
- why is waterfall outdated in many cases?
  - setup cost of many phases is trending towards zero
  - provides little continous feedback

### The Difference

- one giant "iteration" of scientific method for waterfall; many small iterations for agile
- waterfall is sequential; agile is concurrent
- waterfall is command and control process; agile is distributed process

## Jira Overview

Jira = software used to help manage, develop, and communicate about work

- **application level**: Jira = a collection of projects
  - **project level**: Project = a collection of issues
    - **issue level**: Issue = a work item

## Visualizing Work

### To Do List

- visually reminds you
- focuses you
- sets priorities
- tracks projects

### Boards

- board is an agile tool used to visualize and manage work
- kanban board, scrum board, task board, project board
- 2-dimensional to-do list

### Why Visualize Work?

- easily see the work of the project
  - allows anyone to see the (true) current state of the project
  - organizes and focuses the team
  - only work on tasks on the board
- manage things
  - easy to add and prioritize the work of the project
  - easy to update work items
- improve the team's way of working by visually identifying problems

### Workflows

- set of columns of a board represent a workflow for completing the work of an issue
- terms used interchangeably are workflow, process, business process, and valuestream
- workflows are broken down into steps (or statuses, states, or stages)

## Kanban Overview

- Agile = mindset
- Common methods include kanban, scrum, XP, etc
  - each embody core principles of agile
- Kanban = an agile method used to manage a continuous queue of work items
  - commonly used ideas
    - limit work in progress
    - remove bottlenecks to improve "flow" of value
    - pull work rather than push work
- Why choose Kanban Method?
  - very lightweight and efficient
  - evolutionary approach of transforming to agile
  - works well if the workflow is service-oriented
    - operations
    - support
    - maintenance development
    - new hire funnel
  - supports multi-team and multi-project workflows
